# Java Projects - OOP Concepts and Collections

Welcome to this repository! This collection includes various Java projects that demonstrate key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as **Abstraction**, **Encapsulation**, **Inheritance**, **Polymorphism**, and more. These projects also utilize Java's powerful **Collections Framework** including **ArrayList** and **HashMap**.

## Projects Overview

This repository contains simple yet powerful Java projects that illustrate core OOP principles. The projects include the following features:

* **CRUD Operations**: Implemented using Java and OOP concepts to handle Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations.
  
* **Abstraction**: Abstract classes and interfaces are used to provide a blueprint for other classes while hiding implementation details.
  
* **Encapsulation**: Data is hidden within POJO (Plain Old Java Object) classes, exposing only necessary fields and methods.
  
* **Inheritance**: Using inheritance to establish a relationship between classes, allowing reusability and extension of code.
  
* **Polymorphism**: Demonstrating method overriding and interfaces to achieve different behaviors in the system.
  
* **Collections**: Java Collections like `ArrayList` and `HashMap` are used to manage dynamic data structures efficiently.

## Technologies Used

* **Java 8+** for all projects
* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts**
* **Collections Framework** (ArrayList, HashMap, etc.)
